## Esitmated Hours

Spendt around 6 hrs reading,watching and looking up Joomla resources

## Content Insights

I've never used Joomla or Joomla like software before so it was an interesting experience having to navigate myself around the system. I mostly spent my inital time watching the tutorials alternating between them and implimenting their lessons onto the webpage. I found that this was an easier way to break up the content into more digestible pieces. I found that once I got an understanding of Joomla I was able to easily edit and navigate the software. Joomla showed me how using a good interface drastically reduces the chances of getting confused or stuck.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Unlike last pracitcal where I already had at least a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. Joomla was almost an entirely new experience. Joomla continued to reinforce the importance to me of independent learning and implimenting the lessons you've learnt going forward
