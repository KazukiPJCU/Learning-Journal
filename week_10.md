## Learning Sass

## Learning Activities

Over the past week, I have embarked on a journey to enhance my web development skills by learning Sass, a powerful CSS preprocessor. To gain a deeper understanding, I engaged in a variety of learning activities including online tutorials and developing a simple webpage using variables, nesting, mixins and extend/inheritance techniques. I first started off with resource 1 a step by step tutorial by W3schools. I also read up on the official Sass documentation in resource 2 to help gain a better understanding of the difference between Sass and Css

## Resource/Links

1. <https://www.w3schools.com/sass/>
2. <https://sass-lang.com/documentation/>

## Estimated Hours

In total I spent around 4 hrs learning and around 1 hr practicing on the website

## Content Insights

Sass has significantly improved my web development experience by introducing features like variables, nesting, mixins, and extend/inheritance. Variables have streamlined the process of creating and maintaining consistent styles throughout the website, while nesting has enhanced the readability of my stylesheets. Mixins have allowed me to reuse blocks of code and reduce redundancy, and extend/inheritance has helped me create more efficient CSS by sharing properties among selectors.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Learning Sass has not only improved my efficiency as a web developer, but it has also made me a more marketable candidate in the competitive job market. By incorporating Sass and a suitable workflow for creating CSS in a simple new website, I have demonstrated my adaptability to new technologies and increased my value to potential employers. Furthermore, this learning experience has reinforced the importance of continuous learning and staying current with industry trends.
