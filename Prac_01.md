# Practical 1

## Week 2 Basic CSS Website

## Learning Activities

To help with this practical I watched multiple html tutorials and used the website w3schools as a resource. These were useful resources for website and css design

## Resource/Links

Main resources

1. <https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp>
2. <https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp>

## Esitmated Hours

Around 5hrs spent reading and looking up HTML and Css

## Content Insights

Initaly I was using Notepad++ as my html website coding program as this was the one used in my previous web design subject. During this practical Lindesy recommended me to use Visual Studio Code. Using VSC initialy was slightly difficult as I didn't have experience using the software, although I quickly got the hang of the basics. Re-learning HTML and CSS meanwhile reminded me of the importance in naming your different class's well, and how having a good structure to your code is important for easier readability

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I think the ability to independently learn new or refresh on prevously learnt topics is important in effectivly finishing jobs/task in a work and overall life environment
