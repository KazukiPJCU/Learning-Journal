# week 3

## Word press

## Learning Activities

This week I watched a wordpress tutorial to get a hang of how to add pages, links and format the website. I also watched a video on siteground hosting of wordpress websites for the upcoming assignment. During the practical this week we practiced group interviews with everyone who decided to come to the practical. This was used to allow us to get an idea and general feel for each other if we would work in a team together.
