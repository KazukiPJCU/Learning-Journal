# week 3

## Word press

## Learning Activities

This week I watched a wordpress tutorial to get a hang of how to add pages, links and format the website. I also watched a video on siteground hosting of wordpress websites for the upcoming assignment. During the practical this week we practiced group interviews with everyone who decided to come to the practical. This was used to allow us to get an idea and general feel for each other if we would work in a team together.

## Esitmated Hours

Spent about an hour watching both videos for developing a Word Press website

## Content Insights

During this week the biggest insight I got was during the group interviews, I used the interviews as a chance to get some personal insight into their work ethic and personality. To see if we would work together well, I was happy to see that there were people who shared similar values and had complementary personalities to myself.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This week the group interview was very insightful into what it takes to work together as a team and how different personaily types and work ethic could negativly impact your work. Using these group interview I now have a greater understanding of my fellow students.
