# week 4

## Deployment

## Learning Activities

During this week I initially found that the idea of utilizing Vagrant appealed to me due to its ability to create reproducible and portable development environments. I soon encountered obstacles that made me question my choice. During the initial Vagrant setup process, I encountered a few hurdles that proved difficult to overcome. First, the documentation was not as comprehensive as I had hoped, which led to confusion and frustration. I decided to look up Vagrant tutorials to help supplement my learning. I first started with resource 1, a short 10 minute tutorial, when that didn't work I moved onto resource 2. After not having any luck with resource 2 I moved onto resource 3. At this point I decided to give setting up Vagrant a rest for the moment and began to watch all the guides I could find. I watched through all of the resources 4 to 7, I'd hoped to form a better understanding of Vagrant. After struggling to make Vagrant work correctly I began to question if Vagrant was the right solution for me. After some research on local hosting I decided to give XAMPP a try, following the guides in resource 8 and 9 I found that XAMPP offered a more straightforward and user-friendly approach to setting up a local development environment for Wordpress hosting.

## Esitmated Hours

I spent about 2.5 hrs going through tutorials and trying to setup a local host

## Content Insights

I found that poor documentation and the lack of up to date resources made configuring and setting up Vagrant to become a major obstacle in my journey to set up a local environment. This week also showed how finding alternative solutions to your problem may sometimes be necessary if the initial solution no longer meets your needs or doesn't work for you.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Some insights I found during this week were, being adaptable, knowing when to change and having the ability to recognize if a certain method isn't working for you. This week also reinforced the notion of having good problem solving skills, troubleshooting issues and finding work around is important. I also experienced how important it is to try to stay informed, and continue to learn new things in the tech industry.

Overall this week taught me a valuable lesson, while something like Vagrant is more powerful and has its own merits compared to XAMPP. It was much more difficult and obtuse than I initially expected. XAMPP on the other hand while not as powerful as Vagrant was much more user friendly, suited my needs and ultimately allowed me to work on developing my website quicker
