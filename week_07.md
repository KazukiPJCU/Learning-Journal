# week 7

## Group Creation

## Learning Activities

During this week I joined a group for the assignment. As a group we set up our communication network, and discussed what we expect from each other and our general plans for the assignment. During this time I also decided to experiment on my own with creating a custom theme and familiarizing myself with the process. To do this I watched a couple of guides on how to create a custom theme on youtube. I first started off with resource 1 which is around 2hrs long, after this I went through resource 2 which is an 8hr long video showing how someone would use a mockup design to create a website. I also read up on resource 3 which is a guide into the process of making a custom theme, this led me to resource 4 which is a guide on how php code works. Something which is needed in creating a custom theme. Unfortunately I had Covid during this time, and although its an excuse caused me to miss the dead line for submitting this learning journal.

## Esitmated Hours

In total watching the youtube videos and guides I would have spend around 11hrs looking into this content

## Content Insights

I found that when forming groups it's important to vet members, who have similar goals or work expectations to yourself. This week also showed the importance of a well organized workflow system like Trello is for setting work goals. And how having good organization can improve the groups workflow by creating clear milestone goals to work towards.

Other insights I got from this week was into researching custom themes and php. Looking at tutorials and trying to find reputable source of information which provide clear and detailed explanations can be challenging at times.

This week also showed the importance of learning as you go, by practicing what you're learning as you follow along the guide. you can gain hands on experience and solidify your understanding of the material and concepts.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

In terms of employability, knowing how to work within a group, having strong project management skills and showcasing that you possess these skills are highly sort after in the labor market. By using Trello to organize the workflow, by assigning task and working within the group I'm gaining hands on experience in whats its like to work on professional group projects. Something that should make me a more attractive prospects when it comes to employment, hopefully.

This week also provided some learning insights, it further reinforced the belief that i work better following along with a tutorial, and practicing the content as it's brought up
